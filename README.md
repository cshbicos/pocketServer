# PocketServer
A pocket knife of a server to test &amp; troubleshoot

Features thus far
  - listen on a TCP port and spit out what has been received

Are there other, probably better, tools out there?
  - Yes
  - And I use them, but they are a pain to find and sometimes get through virus scanners, various OSes etc
